## How to prepare the documentation

The documentation is written in LaTeX. In order to compile the document a TeX distribution is needed. The recommended one is texlive.

The latexmk tool is recommended. It makes the task of compiling LaTeX
documents easier.

latexmk -pvc -pdf -output-directory=_build source-language
```
